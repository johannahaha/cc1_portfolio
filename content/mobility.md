# Mapping Cities - Making Cities

## Our Mobility in Knots

This project is still in progress
.
I will add a more detailed description once we finish the project.
This project I developed together with Helmut Büttner and Sascha Höver as part of the Mapping Cities – Making Cities by Prof. Dr. Marian Dörk at University of Applied Sciences Potsdam, Winter semester 2021/22. Our data and project partner was the MaaS L.a.b.s. of the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam.
You can see the current state of the project here: https://ourmobilityinknots.netlify.app

For the implementation, I used Python and Networks to process the data, and Vue.js, D3, and Scrollama to create the website. The codebase is in this git repo: https://github.com/johannahaha/website_mapping_maas
