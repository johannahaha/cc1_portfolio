This projects takes an unusual look at mobility data of Potsdam citizens. We developed a way to show mobility in a network format. This allows a focus on the mode of transportations and interconnectedness, instead of focussing on paths and distances.

For the implementation, I used Python and Networks to process the data, and Vue.js, D3, and Scrollama to create the website. The codebase is in this git repo: https://github.com/johannahaha/website_mapping_maas

This project I developed together with Helmut Büttner and Sascha Höver as part of the Mapping Cities – Making Cities by Prof. Dr. Marian Dörk at University of Applied Sciences Potsdam, Winter semester 2021/22. Our data and project partner was the MaaS L.a.b.s. of the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam.
