# Creative Coding

In the class Creative Coding in the first term of my master we started by using Processing and P5 to generate art work and patterns. Later, we moved on to web developmement principles. As a final project, I implemented this portfolio website with Gridsome, a Static Side Generator for Vue.

## Processing and P5

## Web GL

This class was also the first time I used three.js and WebGL by doing this Christmas Tree (it was december...).

In the class Theoretical Background of Audio and Graphics I experimented with generating meshes from vertices, faces and normals.

## Final Project

This was my portfolio website, which I did as a final project. I implemented it with Gridsome, a Static Side Generator for Vue. I redesigned the website in the meantime with the version you can currently see, but the back-end stayed the same.
