# ScenARy

ScenARy is a previsualisation tool to facilitate and support communication about the stage set between different actors in the theatre.
I developed the augmented reality app with a team of eight students in cooperation with the Landestheater Linz and first.stage. At the Landestheater, we evaluated and further developed the app scientifically with some theatre staff.

## Technical conception:
With ScenARy, users can draw their own stage objects, scan real objects or select them from a library. Users can flexibly decide where the stage should be previsualised. The objects can be placed directly on the stage or on a table with the help of augmented reality and SLAM. Alternatively, the objects can be mapped onto playing cards.

## My main tasks:
Realisation of the drawing of own objects (frontend and backend), conversion of the drawing to Augmented Reality objects, C# programming, evaluation at the theatre, conception of the object library, scientific documentation.
