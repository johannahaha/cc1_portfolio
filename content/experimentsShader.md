# Shaders: Experiments with Fragments Shaders.
## Fragment Shader: Islamic Pattern

In our course procedural generation and simulation, we had the task to create different fragment shaders with concepts of Islamic patterns. Here are my results.

We also had a workshop about Shader Programming, where we experimented with Sphere Tracing and Ray Marching. We had some code templates, which we experimented with. Here are two results:
