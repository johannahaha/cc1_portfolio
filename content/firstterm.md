# Stories about Algorithm Ethics: The BAMF Case

This project is a website, that is interactive visualisation of a case of algorithmic bias in Germany.
I did this project as the final project of the first term of my master study program.

The case is the Arabic dialect recognition algorithm for refugees, which is part of the identity management system of the BAMF and used to verify region of origin for refugees (AlgorithmWatch, 2020; Biselli, 2018; Bundesamt für Migration und Flüchtlinge, 2019; Bundesamt für Migration und Flüchtlinge 2020 ). The decision for the case was made in an intensive research process. I chose this particular case because it is a case of a machine learning algorithm used by the German government, which has been used nationwide in Germany since three years (Bundestag-Drucksache 19/6647, 2018). Moreover, the BAMF announced briefely that there are planning a pilot project for using this algorithm in the EU.

The project was exhibited at "Beyond the Frame" at the 50th International Student Film Festival Sehsüchte.

## Implementation

I used vue and three.js to create the website. 

You can find the source code and the documentation [here](https://github.com/johannahaha/stories_about_algorithm_ethics) on my github.
