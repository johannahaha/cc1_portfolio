# Fonté

I implemented this communication design work together with two students. The goal was to develop a brand identity and design manual for a chocolate fondue cafe. In this project we developed brand strategy, logo and concept of colors and patterns that communicated the identity of the café.

In this design we implemented various mockups, prototypes and social media appearances. Finally, the café was prototyped, conveying the desired mood immersively. Fonté stands for a chocolate fondue that conveys the healthy, fresh aspect of strawberries in addition to the sweetness. The slogan "The Healthy Sweet Moment" shows that a personal, happy moment is to be created in the process. Elements in the café such as a Polaroid wall and messages from other guests reinforce this feel-good moment. The logo and design pattern are inspired by watercolors, conveying the playfulness of Fonté's chocolate fondue without being heavy-handed.
