# Exhibition Management and Curation at Sehsuechte Film Festival

The Exhibition "Beyond the Frame" is part of the [International Student Film Festival Sehsüchte](https://sehsuechte.de/en/). In 2021, Sehsüchte had its 50th anniversary.

The exhibition aims to present new forms of storytelling, interactive media, installations, immersive experiences, and digital art.

I was part of the Exhibition Management Team. We curated the art pieces and organized the exhibition and exhibition space.

Here you can see some impressions of the exhibition.
