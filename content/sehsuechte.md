# Exhibition Managment and Curation at Sehsuechte Film Festival

The Exhibition "Beyond the Frame" is part of the International Student Film Festival Sehsuechte. In 2021, Sehsuechte had its 50 year anniversary.

The exhibition aims to present new form of storytelling, interactive media, installations, immersive experiences and digital art.

I was part of the Exhibition Managment Team. We curated the art pieces and organized the exhibition and exhibition space.

Here you can see some impressions of the exhibition.
