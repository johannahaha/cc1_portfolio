The course Instavis was about how complex climate data can be visualized in Instagram Infographics. It was a collaboration of the [Urban Complexity Lab](https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/) of the University of Applied Science Potsdam and the climate journalism Instagram channel [klima.taz](https://www.instagram.com/klima.taz) of the German newspaper taz.

I worked in a team together with Anna Eschenbacher and Lutricia Valentin. We investigated the topic of inequality in the climate crisis. From two different papers, we extracted data and information, out of which we then developed a design and communication concept for Instagram Feed Posts.

## Electricity

Caption:
The study analyzed the energy footprint of countries worldwide for different categories, such as Vehicle Fuel, Food, or Recreational Items. They also looked at the difference between income groups both nationally and globally. Their findings show large inequalities in the energy food prints and higher energy food prints for different world regions. Europe is a region with a higher energy footprint. üá™üá∫

One example of that is the expenditure on Electricity and Heating. Since in some countries in the EU heating functions with electricity, we took both categories together. Except for Malta, every EU country has a higher expenditure and therefore consumption of heating and electricity than the global average. On the graph, the size of the bulb is the expenditure on heating and electricity per person. The length of the string refers to the population - you can tell that we cheated a bit here for the global population of course. üí°

## Vehicle Fuel

The study analyzed the energy footprint of different countries worldwide for categories such as vehicle fuel, food, or recreational items. They also looked at the difference between income groups both nationally and globally. Their findings show large inequalities in the energy food prints and higher energy food prints for high-income households. üíµ

Vehicle fuel is one example of that. Across all income classes in all countries, the top 10 % consume 187 times more vehicle fuel than the bottom 10 % of the world population. Together with package holidays, it is the category with the highest inequality. üöó

## Climate Anxiety

The climate crisis is an anxiety-provoking topic for future generations. This study is the largest international study on climate anxiety among young people. 10.00 people between 16 and 26 were, e.g., asked how worried they were about climate change and how their feelings about climate change impacted their functioning in daily life. The researchers also asked about beliefs about the government's responses to the climate crisis. Yet, the study was only published as a preprint, but the final version will be published soon. üåè

## Redesign for Klimataz

[klima.taz](https://www.instagram.com/klima.taz) decided to publish our climate anxiety post on their feed. We redesigned the post in the klima.taz design again before the publication in January 2021.
