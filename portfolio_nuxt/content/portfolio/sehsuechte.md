# Exhibition Management and Curation at Sehsuechte Film Festival

The Exhibition "Beyond the Frame" is part of the [International Student Film Festival Sehsüchte](https://sehsuechte.de/en/). In 2021, Sehsüchte had its 50th anniversary. The exhibition aims to present new forms of storytelling, interactive media, installations, immersive experiences, and digital art.

In 2021, I was part of the Exhibition Management Team. We curated the art pieces and organized the exhibition and exhibition space.

In 2022, I was one of two Lead Managers for Exhibition and managed the team, application and curation process, and the setup and design of the exhibition.
